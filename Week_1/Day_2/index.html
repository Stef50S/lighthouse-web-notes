        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>An autistic man from Montreal, Quebec (Canada) pursuing Software Development</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Stefano Commodari and I'm a 23 year old male striving to develop my programming skills. My hobbies include playing video games, exercising at 
          the gym (or at home), hanging out with my friends and spending time with my girlfriend, Mina. I recently graduated from McGill university in Software Engineering
          (Bachelor's Degree) and I'm ready to start my career. Despite my introverted nature, I have experience working in teams and managing/organizing the 
          tasks needed to complete a project. I have been described by friends and family as kind, compassionate, gentle, funny and laid back.
          My fascination with technology and its potential is the main factor in my interest for software development. The ability to contribute to a project that can potentially
          benefit large amounts of people is both satisfying and rewarding. At the moment, I'm still unsure about what path I want to take as a developer. As a result, I want
          to expand my programming knowledge and skills as much as I can to help determine what path is right for me.   
        </p>
